    "OpenStreetMap data from the city of Austin, TX was parsed and cleaned using Python and MongoDB. This data was a pre-selected metro area by MapZen and can be retrieved using the OSM XML button on this [webpage](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/austin_texas/). The OpenStreetMap data is in XML format so we wrote a python script, *convert_to_json.py*, to parse the data and export it into a JSON file. The *process_map* function in this file was previously provided by a lesson in the Udacity Data Wrangling course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Austin was selected as the city because I explored it quite a bit during my co-op in Texas last semester. By cleaning the data, I hope to help future tourists that may be using apps that pull from this dataset.\n",

    "Three fields in the dataset that will be audited include building heights, state address, and zip codes.\n",

    "**PLEASE NOTE:** \n",

    "Running the `sample_buildings` MongoDB aggregation pipeline in the *buildings.py* file, we found values with more than 2 decimal places for the building height field.

    "As can be seen, the values of the hours are of all sorts of formats based on what the user who submitted the data is familiar with. Additionally, some of the bars don't list which days they are open either. Standardizing this data for future comparisons would be ideal. However, parsing this data and converting it into a single format would be very complex. Thus, we suggest tackling the problem at its source. OpenStreetMap could provide a standardized format to input hours."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, implementation of the above auditing scripts will allow Open Street Map users to have access to cleaner and more complete addresses. Furthermore, further analysis of building heights will be quicker and cleaner with standardized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some problems that may arise by implementing this improvement are potential additional conversions of float and integer fields to strings for manipulation (i.e. zip code extraction). If this improvement is implemented, the scripts would be needed to run again as more data as added to ensure consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem that may arise would be future zip code entries that contain no digits. Our current implementation would accept this string data and display it. Many changes will need to be made to include this data in another field if it is related or exclude it completely."
